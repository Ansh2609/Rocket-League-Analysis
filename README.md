Rocket League Skillshots Clustering Analysis

This project applies K-Means and DBSCAN clustering techniques to analyze skillshot data from Rocket League. Using pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn, the dataset is preprocessed, normalized, and clustered to identify patterns in player performance.

Key Features:
	‚Ä¢	Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and standardizes numerical features.
	‚Ä¢	K-Means Clustering: Determines optimal clusters using the Elbow Method and calculates Silhouette Score.
	‚Ä¢	DBSCAN Clustering: Identifies natural groupings with density-based clustering.
	‚Ä¢	Visualizations: Includes scatter plots for clustering and a heatmap of cluster feature averages.

üîç The project provides insights into how different gameplay factors influence skillshots, helping to categorize player behaviors effectively.
